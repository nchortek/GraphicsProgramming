


No copy-pasting code.
Only write code you understand!
If you don't understand it, research / play around with it until you do
--> But don't go on tangents or down rabbit holes, learn just enough so you know how the code works
--> Also in tutorials feel free to write down things you learn that would be important to remember in the future!
--> --> Like how value initialization is populating a given struct, for example

Keep moving forward!
--> When working and you think of things you'd like to do in the future, note them in todo comments
--> --> Eventually these can become github issues / "tickets"
