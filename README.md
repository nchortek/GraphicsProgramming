# This is a place to hold my work on tutorials on my way to becoming a graphics/rendering software engineer. My ongoing career goal is to use computer graphics programming techniques to empower artists to create immersive and physically accurate virtual experiences. 

Thus far I have completed the https://learnopengl.com/Introduction tutorial, up through the Model Loading chapter. This amounts to the implementation of a basic renderer using C++, OpenGL and GLSL with support for the following features:
- Phong lighting model
- Spotlights
- Directional lights
- Point lights
- Model loading via the Assimp library to manage mesh and texture data
- Diffuse maps
- Specular maps

The main code for the rendering loop can be found here:

Before beginning graduate school, I hope to complete the https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ tutorial as well, which is currently in-progress.
